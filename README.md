# Shopify - a simple eCommerce app

Welcome to my E-commerce App! This project is a dummy e-commerce application built using React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, TypeScript, and Redux Toolkit. It aims to showcase various features commonly found in e-commerce platforms, including a homepage, product listing page, cart functionality, and user-authenticated pages like account and wishlist.

## Features

- **Homepage:** Introduce users to your e-commerce platform with attractive banners, featured products, and navigation options.
- **Product Page:** Display a catalog of products with detailed information, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
- **Cart:** Allow users to add products to their cart, view cart contents, and proceed to checkout.
- **User Authentication:** Enable users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features like wishlists and account settings.
- **Wishlist:** Allow users to save products they're interested in for future reference.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
- **Vite:** A modern build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development for faster performance.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.
- **Redux Toolkit:** A simplified state management library for managing application state efficiently.
- **Cypress:** A next-generation front-end testing tool designed for the modern web.
